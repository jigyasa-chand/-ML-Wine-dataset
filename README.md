# ML-Wine-dataset
The classification task is to determine, based on various parameters, whether a wine quality is over 7.


Part 1: Implemented own version of the decision tree using binary univariate split, entropy and information gain.

Part2:  Cross-Validation: Evaluated the decision tree using 10-fold cross validation

Part 3: Improvement Strategies:Improved decision tree algorithm using below:
• Use Gini index instead of entropy
• Use multi-way split (instead of binary split)
• Use multivariate split (instead of univariate)
• Prune the tree after splitting for better generalization
